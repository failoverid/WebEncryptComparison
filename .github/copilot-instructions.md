This project is a web-based Next.js application for comparing symmetric encryption algorithms (AES, Twofish, Camellia) and modes (CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR) on client-side files. All logic is implemented in the browser using JavaScript/TypeScript. The app includes file upload, algorithm/mode selection, performance measurement, and visualization. All dependencies must use the latest stable versions. The app is containerized with Docker.
